# My Learning Progress

**Here is what I have learned so far about Git, GitHub, and sharing projects online:**

- **What is GitHub?**  
  GitHub is a platform that lets you store and share code or other files online. It is widely used for collaboration and version control.

- **What is Git?**  
  Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your files and collaborate with others. GitHub uses Git under the hood.

- **GitHub Desktop**  
  GitHub Desktop is an application that gives you a simple interface to interact with your GitHub repositories, making it easier to manage projects without using the command line.

- **How to Create a GitHub Account**  
  Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up with your email address to create a free account.

- **What is a Repository?**  
  A repository (repo) is a storage space for your project. It contains all your files, folders, and the entire history of changes made to them.

- **What is a Commit?**  
  A commit is like saving a snapshot of your project. Every time you commit, you record the changes you've made, so you can go back to them later if needed.

- **How to Host a Website on GitHub Pages**  
  You can share your web projects online for free using GitHub Pages:
  1. Create a repository on GitHub.
  2. Add your HTML, CSS, and other web files to the repository.
  3. In the repository settings, scroll to "Pages", choose the branch (usually `main`) and root folder, and save.
  4. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository`
